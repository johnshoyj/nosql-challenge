# nosql-challenge

In this challange I setup a MongoDB database and associated collection and documents within Jupyter notebook. I then updated the database by adding a new restaurant, updating it's BusinessTypeID, and removing documents in the collection where "Dover" was the local authority. Lastly, I changed the latitude, longitude, and rating value data types. 

Next, I performed an exploratory analysis to answer the following questions: 
Question 1: Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20? 
Question 2: Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
Question 3: What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
Question 4: How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas. 

This code is a combination of my original work and code learned in the UMN Data Science Bootcamp.
